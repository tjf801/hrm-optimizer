# hrm-optimizer
 an optimizer for the assembly language in the game "Human Resource Machine"

TO DO:
 - Extend `.hrm` files to include memory layout info (maybe include level number?)
 - Dataflow analysis passes
 - Note all optimizations in made in [the solutions repo](https://github.com/atesgoral/hrm-solutions)
 - Make and formalize a memory model for "indirect access" (pointers)
